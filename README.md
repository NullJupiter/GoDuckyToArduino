# Ducky code to Arduino code converter
### Description:
This is a ducky code converter to convert ducky code ment for rubber ducky USB to working arduino code.
It uses the Keyboard.h header file which is included in the standard library of the official Arduino IDE. With that
you can just use that code for ATmeg32u4 chips which are assembled on for example the Arduino Leornado or the Arduino Pro Micro.
